Built and submitted to the [Spare Time Collective Blog](http://sparetimecollective.tumblr.com/).
Spare Time is a push to stay creative after a day at work. It is a space for creatives to submit the personal projects they do after hours. There are no guidelines except for the monthly theme which can be taken in any direction. This months theme was "time".

Project inspired by [wouterdevinck's](https://github.com/wouterdevinck/wordclock) [wordclock](https://github.com/wouterdevinck/wordclock) project.
